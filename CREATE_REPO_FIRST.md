# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Create Repository on GitHub First

Before pushing, you MUST create the repository on GitHub.com

## Steps to Create Repository on GitHub:

### 1. Visit GitHub Create Repository Page

Open this link in your browser:
https://github.com/new

### 2. Fill in Repository Details

| Field                     | Value                             |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Repository name**       | `GoCylone`                        |
| **Description**           | `ASP.NET Core Bus Booking System` |
| **Visibility**            | Select "Public" or "Private"      |
| **Initialize repository** | ❌ UNCHECK - "Add a README file"  |
| **Add .gitignore**        | ❌ UNCHECK                        |
| **Add a license**         | ❌ UNCHECK                        |

### 3. Click "Create repository"

You will see a page with commands. Look for:

```
git remote add origin https://github.com/asini99899/GoCylone.git
```

---

## After Creating the Repository

Your repository URL will be:

```
https://github.com/asini99899/GoCylone
```

Once it's created, the commands I've already run will work!

---

## Complete Flow:

1. ✅ We've already initialized Git locally
2. ✅ We've already added files and committed
3. ✅ We've added the remote URL
4. ⏳ YOU NEED TO: Create the empty repository on GitHub.com
5. Then we'll push the code

---

## What to Do Right Now:

1. **Go to https://github.com/new**
2. **Fill in the form with details above**
3. **Click "Create repository"**
4. **Come back and tell me "Done"**
5. **Then I'll push your code!**

The repository will be empty at first. After creating it, your git push command will succeed and upload all 105 files!
